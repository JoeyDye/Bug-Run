# Bug Run

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the project to your local computer. Next open index.html in your favorite browser. This will start up the game. Once the game is open, you can begin playing. See gameplay instructions below.

Note that for improved performance, I've also included a Gulp file you can use to build the application. You will need to run `npm install` to download all dev dependencies. Then, simply run `gulp` in the root directory to set up the build file. Once set up, you can use the new index.html file from you newly created build folder to run the game.

## Gameplay

Start the game by selecting a player.

To play, use the following arrow keys to move the player across the screen.

* ↑ up
* ↓ down
* → right
* ← left

## Winning the Game

Your goal is to get the player to the star without being hit by an enemy. If your player collides with an enemy, he/she will revert back to the starting position. Once your player reaches the star, you win.
